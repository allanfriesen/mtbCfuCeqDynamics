    "## Power analysis for proposed experiment to measure decay rate of Mtb genomes ##\n",

    "This code simulates the proposed experiment for measuring the decay rate of Mtb genomes in mice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because indivdual mouse data were unavailable, we had to make assumptions about sources of uncertainty, in order to perform the simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on Fig. 4A of Munoz-Elias *et al*., Infection and Immunity, 2005, we assumed that viable bacteria population at 4 weeks post-infection was log-normally distributed about the value $10^5$, with standard deviation equal to 0.2 log10.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same figure, 4A, initial average CEQs were actually lower than initial average CFUs, which corresponds to an unreasonable negative population of dead bacteria, in the DD model. To deal with this, we assumed a log-normally distributed population of dead bacteria genomes at 4 weeks post-infection. We chose the center of that distribution to correspond to CFUs/CEQs = 0.1, 0.5, or 0.9. Note that averages will differe slightly from these values. We then chose the standard deviation of the distribution to match the estimated *absolute* uncertainty in CEQs, based on the published calibration curve for qPCR (Fig. 2B of Munoz-Elias *et al*., Infection and Immunity, 2005); note that uncertainty would be drastically underestimated if we matched the uncertainty of log D to that of log Q, since D is orders of magnitude smaller than Q.\n",
    "\n",
    "The replication rate is based on our analysis of the data in Fig. 2A, between 4 and 8 weeks post-infection ($r_3$).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then used the estimated slope of the CFUs vs. time in Fig. 4A to estimate the death rate of Mtb in mice during treatment with INH."
